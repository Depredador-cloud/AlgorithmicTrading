# AlgorithmicTrading
New project for algorithmic trading practice and concept research

# Research
From the research I did on the job market, I learned that C#, C++, and Python are the most commonly used languages for algorithmic trading. While Java, Rust, and Go were mentioned, they were barely used.

**Mentions in the Job postings**
* GO 3%
* C# 16%
* C++ 38%
* Python 33%
* R 5%
* Java 5%

Note that when C++ is mentioned, Python is also likely to be mentioned, or all three top languages C#, C++, and Python 
are mentioned together. So it would make most sense to choose one of the top 3 languages. I have experience with all of 
them, and I believe C# and Python might be best for this project. Therefore, it would make the most sense to choose one 
of these top three languages.
